# Custom ML Library from Scratch

This project is a custom machine learning (ML) library implemented from scratch, following Gerard Taylor's YouTube tutorial as a starting point. The primary objective of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of machine learning algorithms and their inner workings while also optimizing and cleaning up the codebase for improved efficiency and readability.
